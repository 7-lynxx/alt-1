        <h2>Reason for Joining Altschool</h2>
        <p id="reason">
          I always have been curious about technology, how parts of it work and wanted to learn about it. <br>
        I also am aware of the need for an outline to learn and understand these things. I heard and read about altschool <br>
        and I believe it would be a really good place to pursue learning about these things that interest me and collaborate with people of <br> like minds.
